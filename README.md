# devops

## Project Description
This project contains all materials related to DevOps in Spark System.  Please ensure all files are organised properly and carefully categorised so that it is very clear and easy to find relevant materials.

## Workflow
All changes must be reviewed before merged to the main branch.  As such, the main branch is protected and only the user with the right permission allowed to accept merges.  Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES developers give themselves this permission without first consulting with the project owner.

- Create a new branch from main for your specific task
- Commit your changes to your task branch.  Be sure to squash the commits to a single commit before submitting for merge request.  Merge request will be rejected immediately if there is more than one commit
- If review is successful, changes will be merged into main branch
- Task branch can be deleted, if desired
